More documentation to come...

The inspiration for this project (and in fact 99.9% of the SafeOrderedDictionary code) comes from [Jon Sterling's](https://github.com/jonsterling) great article ["A Pattern for Immutability"](http://www.jonmsterling.com/posts/2012-12-27-a-pattern-for-immutability.html).  

I've taken the liberty of forking `RAFOrderedDictionary` from Jon's [ReactiveFormlets project](https://github.com/jonsterling/ReactiveFormlets) for use here.  Please join me in thanking him for his generous contribution to open source!
